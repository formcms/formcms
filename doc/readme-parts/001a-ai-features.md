## Unique AI-Native Features: The Future of Web Development

FormCMS stands apart as the first **AI-native CMS**, fundamentally changing how developers and content creators interact with data and design. By integrating advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) through **Formmate**, FormCMS automates the most time-consuming aspects of building and managing web applications.

### 🤖 AI Schema Generation (Natural Language Data Modeling)
Forget manual table creation and relationship mapping. With FormCMS, you can describe your business domain in natural language (e.g., *"Design an online bookstore with authors, genres, and customer reviews"*), and the AI will:
- **Design Entities**: automatically create the necessary database tables.
- **Define Attributes**: choose appropriate data types (String, Int, Datetime, etc.) and display types (Image, Editor, Lookup).
- **Map Relationships**: correctly setup Many-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many links.

### 🔍 AI Query Generation
Harness the full power of GraphQL without writing complicated syntax. Tell FormCMS what data you need (e.g., *"Get the top 10 most popular books along with their author names and total reviews"*), and the AI will generate the optimized GraphQL query for you, which is then automatically converted into a cached RESTful endpoint.

### 🎨 AI Page Generation
Building dynamic frontends has never been faster. Use natural language commands to generate complete, data-bound pages (e.g., *"Create a landing page for a course named 'Modern C#' with a hero section, lesson list, and instructor bio"*). The AI leverages the integrated **Grapes.js** designer and **Handlebars** to build fully functional, responsive layouts that are immediately connected to your backend data.

### 📝 AI Data Generation
Accelerate your prototyping and testing by generating realistic mock data at scale. Specify the entity and the desired traits, and the AI will populate your database with high-quality, varied content that respects your schema's constraints and relationships.

*FormCMS transforms the traditional development cycle into an intuitive, AI-guided conversation.*
